 Quiz 2 is on Tuesday, October 3, 6-7 pm.

 Term Test is on Tuesday, October 24, 6-7 pm.

 Quiz 3 is on Tuesday,  November 14 , 6-7 pm.

 Quiz 4 is on Tuesday, November 21, 6-7 pm.

  

 Pre-class Quizzes on Quercus

 Prior to each week (starting Wednesdays), students are required to read relevant sections from the textbook, and complete an online
 quiz on Quercus, by Tuesdays, at midnight (see the course schedule on the website). If there is an in-class quiz on Tuesday, the
 deadline for submitting the pre-class quiz is extended till the midnight of the upcoming Wednesday.

 The pre-class quizzes count as 5% of the overall course mark. There are 12 pre-class quizzes in total, but only the best 10 will
 count towards the final course mark.

 In-class Polling 

 Each class will  start with  "Polling Questions" that will help you and your instructor check understanding of the basic concepts.
 These questions are graded for participation only. We will use the MathMatize platform for running polls. Instructions for
 setting up a MathMatize account are posted on the course page.

  Participation in polls is worth 3% of your final grade. To earn the full 3% you must participate in a minimum of 80% of  polls.
  Please note that this requires you to bring a device (e.g. smart phone, tablet, laptop) which can connect to the internet in class. 
 Penalties for Lateness
 Each student can request a 24h extension for HW (not pre-class quizzes) once during the semester. If you need to submit your HW
 late, you must notify the assistant coordinator  that you have used your 24h extention. Otherwise, your HW will normally get a
 grade of 0. Your email should include your name, your student id # and the HW for which you are using the extension. Other
 than these extensions, late assignments will  not be accepted, and the score of 0 will be given for the late assignment (even if it is
 just one minute late). Therefore, try to finish a homework at least few hours before the deadline. 

 Please note that there is no extension or make up for pre-class quizzes.

  
 Procedures and Rules
 Missed Term Work
 If you miss a test or quiz for illness or any other valid reason, you must report your absence on ACORN. (No further documentation
 is required.)

 One missed quiz: the other three quizzes count for 8% each. (The missed quiz becomes the "dropped quiz".)

 Two missed quizzes: the other two quizzes count for 8% each, and the final exam counts for 48%.

 Three missed quizzes: the written quiz counts for 12% and the final counts for 52%. (If three quizzes missed and the test also
 missed then the written quiz counts for 14% and final exam counts for 66%).

 Four missed quizzes and term test written: the term test counts for 28% and the final counts for 52%.

 Four missed quizzes and term test missed: You must write the make up test.  in this case the make up test counts for 20% and
 the final exam counts for 60%. If the make up test will be missed the grade for all quizzes and term test will normally be 0 and the
 final exam counts for 40%.

 Missed Term Test: The weight of the term test will be moved to the final, so in this case the final counts for 56%.

 There is no make-up for missed homework (but 4 out of 5 will be counted) or reading pre-class quizzes.

  

  

  

 Missed Final Exam
 Students who cannot complete their final examination due to illness or other serious causes must file an online petition within 72
 hours of the missed examination. Late petitions will NOT be considered. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a non-
 refundable fee of $72 is required for each examination approved.

 Academic Integrity
 Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the
 University of Toronto Mississauga is a strong signal of each student’s individual academic achievement. As a result, UTM treats
 cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. The University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines
 behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the process for addressing academic offences. Potential offences include, but
 are not limited to:

 In papers and assignments:

     1. Using someone else's ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement.
     2. Submitting your own work in more than one course, or more than once in the same course, without the permission of the
        instructor.
     3. Making up sources or facts.
     4. Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment.

 On tests and exams:

     1. Using or possessing unauthorized aids.
     2. Looking at someone else’s answers during an exam or test.
     3. Misrepresenting your identity.

 In academic work:

     1. Falsifying institutional documents or grades.
     2. Falsifying or altering any documentation required, including (but not limited to) doctor's notes.

 All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on
 Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate
 research and citation methods, you are expected to seek out additional information on academic integrity from your instructor or
 from other institutional resources.

 Plagiarism Detection
 Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of
 textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source
 documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that
 apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site
 (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq).

 Students may wish to opt out of using the plagiarism detection tool. In order to opt out, contact your instructor by email no later
 than two (2) weeks after the start of classes. If you have opted out, then specific information on an alternative method to submit
 your assignment can be found below.

 Informed Consent – Email Lists
 As a student enrolled in this course, you understand that you are providing your implicit consent to be included in an email list for
 the department to send you non-essential information from time to time. If you do not wish to be included in such an email list,
 please request to be removed by contacting one of the Academic Advisors & Undergraduate Program Administrators. Their
 information can be found on the MCS Website Contact Us page .

 Duration:             3 hours
 Additional Information
  

 All emails to course staff should come from your "utoronto" email account, and contain "MAT 102" in the subject heading. If your
 question is about  course policy or other administrative matters (e.g. missed assessments, illness) you should contact the course
 coordinator (Marina Tvalavadze marina.tvalavadze@utoronto.ca). The discussion board is a great place to ask questions, and you
 can often get an answer more quickly by posting there.
  

 Use of Generative AL in assignments

 Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically foundational models that can create writing, computer code, and /or images
 using minimal human prompting, are proliferating and becoming ubiquitous. This includes not only GPT-4 (and its siblings
 ChatGPT and Bing), but many writing assistants that are built on this or similar AI technologies.

 In this course, students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence tools, to contribute to
 their understanding of course materials. However, students may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, quizzes,
  creating computer code, or completing  course assignments. However, these tools may be useful when gathering information from
 across sources and assimilating it for understanding.

 Last Date to drop course from Academic Record and GPA is November 6, 2023.
